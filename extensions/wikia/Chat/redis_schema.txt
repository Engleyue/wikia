Redis doesn't actually require a schema.  This is just here as a reference so that
other developers will know what is being stored in redis and in what format.

Brackets aren't actually in the keys. They are just there to indicate where there is
a substitution.



== The list of all of the rooms on a given wiki (stored as ) ==
REDIS_PREFIX_ROOMS_ON_WIKI = "rooms_on_wiki"
KEY: "[REDIS_PREFIX_ROOMS_ON_WIKI]:[wgCityId]"
VALUE OF EACH ITEM IN LIST: Room id of a room on the given wiki.

== Each room's info (stored as HASH) ==
REDIS_PREFIX_ROOMS = "room"
room id is assigned by redis upon creation.
KEY: "[REDIS_PREFIX_ROOMS]:[room id]"
VALUE: HASH of the info about the chat room
	FIELDS IN THE HASH:
		room_id # i'm not convinced that this is necessary
		room_name
		room_topic
		activeClients
		wgCityId
		wgServer
		wgArticlePath
