 *
 * This extension is built to help fix a problem with lost data.
 *
 * A 16-hour old backup was loaded into production and users created during that period
 * were initially lost and their original ids were assigned to new users.  The data for those
 * users was recovered, but now their IDs are different.  Since password hashes are salted with
 * the original user id, these restored users won't be able to log in normally.
 *
 * This extension will detect all failed logins and then update their password hashes to use the
 * new ids.  The login attempts will be logged so that we can determine when this conversion is
 * complete and the extension is no longer needed.

 * then will check the password using their old user id for the salt, then will log the outcome.  If they
