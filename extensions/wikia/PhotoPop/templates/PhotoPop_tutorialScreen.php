Tutorial screen will go here</br>

Should just wrap a stripped-down version of the playGame template so that the tutorial doesn't have
to be constantly updated any time the game changes... after the stripped down version (no external JS, etc.) is
shown, then we just need to add extra code for the dialog box w/the button on it.
