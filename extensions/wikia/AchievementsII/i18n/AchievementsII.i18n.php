You can use rectangular pictures, but you might find that a bit gets cropped out by the frame.

If you don\'t, then just experiment with different pictures until you find the ones that work for you!

To create a new "Edit in category" track, type the name of the category in the field below. The regular Edit track will still exist; this will create a separate track that you can customize separately.<br /><br />
When the track is created, the new badges will appear in the list on the left, under the regular Edit track. Customize the names and images for the new track, so that users can see the difference!<br /><br />
Once you have done the customization, click the "enabled" checkbox to turn on the new track, and then click "Save changes". Users will see the new track appear on their user profiles, and they will start earning badges when they edit pages in that category. You can also disable the track later, if you decide you do not want to highlight that category anymore. Users who have earned badges in that track will always keep their badges, even if the track is disabled.<br /><br />
